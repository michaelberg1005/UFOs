# UFOs
Module 11 Javascript work
## Purpose of the project
I put together a html page that takes the UFO sighting data and puts it into a filterable table, which allows users to easily search UFO sightings by either date, city, state, country or shape of the sighting. This allows users to robustly filter through a large data set to see if there are UFO sightings that match any of 5 different criteria they could be looking for (date, city, state, country and shape). 
## Technologies used in the project
In the project we used a number of technologies, including javascript, html, d3 javascript library, Bootstrapping (for website formatting) and CSS styling to help with the bootstrapping. These technologies combined to form a robust functioning html page for the UFO sightings, that is also clean and easy to read.
## Recommendation for further development
One recommendation I have for further development would be to add one more filter that could filter by key words in the comments column. This way, a user could search/filter by a key aspect or word in the description/comment.
